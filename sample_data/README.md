## Practice Ideas

1. **Read `users.csv`** and filter for active users only
2. **Parse `app.log`** and count errors by hour
3. **Merge `config.json`** with `nested_config.json`
4. **Read `sales.csv`** with pandas and calculate totals by region
5. **Update `server.config`** to change the PORT value
6. **Calculate word frequency** from `story.txt`
